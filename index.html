            <h3 id="programming">What is Programming?</h3>
            <p><em>Programming</em> is a broad field that is fundamentally involved in 
              <span class="tooltip">computing
                <span class="tooltiptext"> the development and operation of computers</span>
              </span>. 
              It encompasses activities such as planning, designing, and implementing computer processes. While often used interchangeably with "coding", 
              the two concepts have distinct differences.</p>
            <p><em>Coding</em> is an aspect of programming that involves the encoding of a set of instructions that is understood and executable
              by a computer. Coding includes various languages for 
              <span class="tooltip">programming,
                <span class="tooltiptext"> e.g. Python, JavaScript, Java, C++</span>
              </span> 
              <span class="tooltip">markup,
                <span class="tooltiptext">e.g. HTML, XML</span>
              </span> and 
              <span class="tooltip">style sheet
                <span class="tooltiptext">e.g. CSS, XSL</span>
                </span>.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3 id="html">What is HTML?</h3>
            <p><em>HTML</em> stands for 
              <span class="tooltip"><em>hypertext</em>
                <span class="tooltiptext">beyond text</span>
              </span>
              <span class="tooltip"><em>markup</em>
                <span class="tooltiptext">adds meaning and context</span>
              </span> 
              <span class="tooltip"><em>language.</em>
                <span class="tooltiptext">has vocabulary, rules, and syntax</span>
              </span> 
              It is one of many languages used in coding and is specifically used for web development. While not a programming language, it
              is still a coding language because it provides a set of instructions on how browsers should display content.</p>
            <p>It is one of the three primary web development languages which include 
              <span class="tooltip"><em>CSS</em>
                <span class="tooltiptext">cascading stylsheet</span>
              </span> and
              <span class="tooltip"><em>JS.</em>
                <span class="tooltiptext">JavaScript</span>
              </span>
              HTML defines the structure and content, CSS defines the presentation and layout, while JS provides the functionality and interactivity.

            <p class="funfact">
              <span class="b">🤓 Author's Markup:</span> If a website is a house, HTML is the floor, walls, ceiling, and roof; CSS is the furnishings; and JS is the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing. Technically, HTML is all one needs, but it's not great to sleep on a cold floor.

            <h3 id="skills">Required Skills</h3>
            <p>Several skills are needed in the field of programming. These include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Attention to detail</strong> — Coding requires a keen eye for details to ensure the proper use of syntax, the maintaining of consistency, and the prevention and cleaning of errors or bugs.</li>
              <li><strong>Communication</strong> — Programming involves various tasks that require communication between different parties to achieve shared goals.</li>
              <li><strong>Inquisitiveness</strong> — Programming encompasses a vast body of knowledge that is continuously being expanded. A curious, open, and eager mind is required to keep abreast of proficiencies and developments.</li>
              <li><strong>Math skills</strong> — Math skills go beyond understanding numbers and their interactions (which are crucial in many programming scenarios). Even more important is the demonstration of mathematical reasoning and an understanding of concepts to solve problems.</li>
              <li><strong>Problem-solving</strong> — Programming involves planning, designing, and implementing computer processes. Whether in large-scale systems development or small-scale webpage coding, solutions and approaches to challenges are the goal.</li>
              <li><strong>Programming language proficiency</strong> — Programming's core goal is to create a set of instructions for a computer. The only way to create these is to know any one of the myriad of languages that computers speak.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflections on Programming</h3>
            <p>Programming has always fascinated Derik. His first exposure to “encoding instructions” came through HTML in high school. Later, during the pandemic, he encountered 
              another form of coding through Google Sheets, when the school had to manage and track operations digitally. Using formulas to automate tasks, update data dynamically, 
              and link databases sparked an unexpected interest in process automation and creating input-output relationships. 
            </p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, and JS are the latest tools in his arsenal to achieve worldwide <del>domination</del> automation.</p>
